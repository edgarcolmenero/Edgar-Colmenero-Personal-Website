                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Edgar Colmenero. I am currently a student at 
                    Tarrant County College, and I plan to transfer to the 
                    University of Texas at Arlington in the Fall of 2025 to pursue 
                    a degree in Computer Science. I have a strong passion for mobile 
                    and web development and possess knowledge in HTML, CSS, iOS, Java, and Python. 
                    I am eager to expand my skill set further. My aspiration is to become a 
                    distinguished Software Developer in the future.

                <h2>My Skills and Interests</h2>
                <p>My skills and interests are deeply rooted in my love for sports and fitness, which have instilled in me essential traits like discipline, teamwork, and resilience—qualities that drive me in my quest to become the best version of myself. I have a strong passion for coding and a continuous desire to expand my knowledge of programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Swift, all while honing my expertise in HTML and CSS. Creating websites and apps excites me, whether it’s for personal enjoyment or to support the growth of small businesses, as I truly believe in making a positive impact. My role as a Bilingual Financial Services Representative at Wells Fargo has enhanced my customer service abilities and provided invaluable insights into the customer service landscape. Understanding what makes customers return has given me a unique perspective as a developer; I now know what to prioritize to ensure user satisfaction. I learned the importance of collaborating with diverse teams and the significance of delivering exceptional service that keeps customers coming back. Additionally, my extensive experience at Walmart has further deepened my understanding of customer needs. Through my commitment to personal growth, I aspire to inspire others by demonstrating that a life that feels extraordinary—and even a bit impossible—is entirely within reach.</p>
